I like to be at the synergetic intersection of physics, art, and code

Some Things:

- 🛠️ Currently building [KittyCAD](https://kittycad.io) with an amazing group of people - our focus is 'Infrastructure for Hardware Designers' to bring CAD and manufacturing into the modern era. [Have questions?](mailto:kittycad@hannahbollar.com) or [Business inquiries?](mailto:hannah@kittycad.io). 🔥[We're Hiring!](https://kittycad.io/careers/)🔥

- 💼 I've done work at a few different places ([KittyCAD](https://kittycad.io/), [Pixar](https://pixar.com), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Cesium](https://cesium.com), [Nvidia](https://nvidia.com), [Penn CG-Research](http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/summerresearch.html), [iDTech](https://www.idtech.com/), ...) and have a lot of things left to do, so stay tuned ;)

- 🎓 Earned a BSE in [Computer Science : Digital Media Design](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/digital-media-design-bse/) and an MSE in [Computer Graphics in Game Technology](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-computer-graphics-and-game-technology/) from [Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/). The place was like a candy shop of things todo - did some TAing (covering math,cs,physics,art,etc), earned some awards, and met a lot of great people (shout out [CG@Penn](cg.cis.upenn.edu)) ~

- 🎨 Have been heavily involved in the computer graphics communites - Penn Siggraph, Penn AWE, have a [Siggraph Member Profile](https://www.siggraph.org/inside-siggraph/member-profiles/profile/?member=hannah-bollar), joined Khronos, and a few other things on the way.

- 🔢 Teaching && Mentoring is important to me - it takes a village to succeed. I couldnt have gotten to where I am without the many mentors and mentees along the way. Honestly, the best interaction is seeing someone else's enthusiasm discovering something new and half the time I also learn something in the process. Some ways I mentor - GenHeration, Polygence, Guest Lecturing at Universities, and plain old just email answering (hello to all you internet people :D ).

- 📬 My [email](mailto:hiya@hanbo.dev) is always open - I may be slow to respond

Some Things, though a bit more random:

- There was a rule created in the NCJLA Lacrosse league because of me

- I wanted to be a bubble-gum salesman when i was 5

- there's a star named after me (got it as a birthday gift) in one of the official registries

- athletically, half the time i'm left-side dominate, half the time it's right, your guess is as good as mine
