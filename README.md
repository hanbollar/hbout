I like to be at the synergetic intersection of physics, art, and code<br/><br/>

Some Things:

- 🐱 Currently building [KittyCAD](https://kittycad.io) with an amazing group of people - our focus is '[Infrastructure for Hardware Designers](https://kittycad.io/product)' to bring CAD and manufacturing into the modern era. [Have questions?](mailto:kittycad@hannahbollar.com) or [Business inquiries?](mailto:hannah@kittycad.io) <br/>🔥[We're Hiring!](https://kittycad.io/careers/)🔥

- 💼 I've done work at a few different places ([KittyCAD](https://kittycad.io/), [Pixar](https://pixar.com), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Cesium](https://cesium.com), [Nvidia](https://nvidia.com), [Penn CG-Research](http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/summerresearch.html), [iDTech](https://www.idtech.com/), ...) and have a lot of things left to do, so stay tuned ;)

- 🎓 Earned a BSE in [Computer Science : Digital Media Design](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/digital-media-design-bse/) and an MSE in [Computer Graphics in Game Technology](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-computer-graphics-and-game-technology/) from [Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/). The place was like a candy shop of things todo - did some TAing (covering math,cs,physics,art,etc), earned some awards, and met a lot of great people (shout out to [CG@Penn](https://cg.cis.upenn.edu)) ~

- 🎨 Have been heavily involved in the computer graphics communites - Penn Siggraph, Penn AWE, have a [Siggraph Member Profile](https://www.siggraph.org/inside-siggraph/member-profiles/profile/?member=hannah-bollar), joined Khronos, and a few other things that are still on the way.

- 🍎 Teaching && Mentoring is important to me. It takes a village to succeed, and I couldnt have gotten to where I am without the support. Some ways I currently mentor - [GenHeration](https://genheration.com/), [Polygence](https://www.polygence.org/), Guest Lecturing at Universities, and plain old just email answering (hello to all you internet people :D ).

Some Things, though a bit more random:

- I wanted to be a bubble-gum salesman when i was 5

- There was a rule created in the NCJLA Lacrosse league because of me

- There's a star named after me in one of the official registries (got it as a birthday gift, thanks Nan!)

- Athletically, half the time i'm left-side dominate, half the time it's right, your guess is as good as mine<br/><br/>


My [email](mailto:hiya@hanbo.dev) is always open 📬 - I may be slow to respond<br/><br/>


Happy coding everyone<br/>
