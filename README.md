Hiya ðŸ‘‹, Hannah here ~

To check out my 'official' history - view my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hannah-bollar) profile

I like to be at the synergetic intersection of physics, art, and code

Some Things:

- Currently building [KittyCAD](https://kittycad.io) with an amazing group of people - our focus is 'Infrastructure for Hardware Designers' to bring CAD and manufacturing into the modern era. [Have questions?](kittycad@hannahbollar.com) or [Business inquiries?](mailto:hannah@kittycad.io).

- I've done work at a few different places (KittyCAD, Pixar, Unity, Cesium, Nvidia, Penn-Research, iDTech, ...) and have a lot of things left to do, so stay tuned ;)

- Earned a BSE in [Computer Science : Digital Media Design](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/digital-media-design-bse/) and an MSE in [Computer Graphics in Game Technology](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-computer-graphics-and-game-technology/) from Penn. The place was like a candy shop of things todo - did some TAing (covering math,cs,physics,art,etc), joined our Siggraph chapter board, founded our AWE chapter, earned some awards. All-in-all, met a lot of really great people (shout out [CG@Penn](cg.cis.upenn.edu)) and had a blast ~

- Teaching && Mentoring is important to me - it takes a village to succeed. Honestly, the best interaction is seeing someone else's enthusiasm discovering something new and half the time I also learn something in the process. Some ways I currently do it - GenHeration, Polygence, and plain old just email answering (hello to all you internet people :D ).

- My [email](mailto:hiya@hanbo.dev) is always open - I may be slow to respond

Some Things, though a bit more random:

- There was a rule created in the NCJLA Lacrosse league because of me

- I wanted to be a bubble-gum salesman when in was 5

- there's a star named after me (got it as a birthday gift) in one of the official registries

- athletically i'm a mess, half the time i'm left-side dominate, half the time it's right, your guess is as good as mine
